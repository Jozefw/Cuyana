Adding Libraries:

My concern for adding libraries was basically bloat. Added them anyways.
Bootstrap is good for layout.
Jquery for functionality and bootstrap dependency.
Sass as a css preprocessor
Grunt as a task runner for a build process.
But is this all too much for one page?

Traditional folder architecture 7:1 for scss. I spent a bit of time on this and then had to compensate on time so, making full use of it may seem rushed.

Fonts did not render and were broken links in Comp, so I took a guess.

"Where the Story Begins" is responsive for desktop but this will need serious thought for mobile and tablet.
